Introduction
============

``Basis`` is a high-level Python package which aims to provide an easy and intuitive way of constructing univariate
basis function systems.

Basis Function Systems
**********************
A basis function system is a collection of known functions :math:`B_k(t)` that are mathematically independent of each
other and they have the property that we can approximate arbitrarily well any function by taking a linear combination of
a sufficiently large number of these functions, [1].
